# APTA Standards Process

We work through the standards process provided by APTA to publish documents that innovators embedded within transit agencies can use to make change inside their organizations. This process emphasizes transparency, inclusivity, and practical implementation guidance to help practitioners advance data standards within their agencies.

## Document Focus

Each standard we publish focuses on either:

- A specific data standard and its end-to-end usage (e.g., GTFS)
- A cross-cutting concern (e.g., data governance)

Our documents provide practical guidance for implementers to maximize the value of agency data, including:

- Landscape analysis of relevant projects and tools
- Best-in-class usage examples and case studies
- Implementation recommendations and best practices

Every document includes:

1. A 1–2 page executive summary outlining:
   - Topic overview and importance
   - Agency stakeholder analysis
   - Department ownership recommendations
2. Detailed implementation guide organized by data lifecycle stages

## Development Process

### 1. Proposal Phase

- Topic proposal including importance and prioritization rationale
- Volunteer coordinator assignment
- Initial scope definition

### 2. Community Brainstorming

We believe the best standards come from diverse perspectives and broad participation. During this phase:

- A collaborative Google Doc is created and shared widely using [our standard template](https://github.com/transit-data-collab/documents/blob/main/templates/community-feedback.md)
- The coordinator provides a basic outline to get things started
- **Everyone is encouraged to contribute**, no matter how small:
    - Drop in quick thoughts or bullet points
    - Share partial ideas that others can build on
    - Add links to relevant examples
    - Point out areas needing more exploration
    - Suggest real-world scenarios to consider

The goal is to gather a rich collection of ideas, experiences, and perspectives. Don't worry about polish or completeness—even fragmentary thoughts can spark valuable discussions or highlight important considerations.

While edit access requires a simple request (to maintain edit attribution), we welcome and encourage participation from:

- Transit agency staff at all levels
- Technology vendors and consultants
- Researchers and academics
- Open source developers
- Anyone with relevant experience or interest

A comment period deadline will be set, but the emphasis is on gathering a diverse range of input rather than rushing to completion.

### 3. Draft Development

- Synthesis of community input into narrative form
- Assignment of research tasks for identified gaps
- Placeholder sections for pending research
- Ongoing revision and incorporation of new findings

### 4. Community Review

- Publication of complete draft for comment
- Documentation of pending research tasks
- Clear review timeline
- Continuous incorporation of feedback

### 5. Release Candidate

- Conversion to Markdown format
- Pull Request to [documents repository](https://github.com/transit-data-collab/documents)
- Final review period
- Incorporation of last-minute feedback

### 6. Official Publication

- Conversion to APTA-formatted Word document
- Submission through APTA editing process
- Reference to GitHub source for latest version
- Creation of version-specific Git tag
- Backporting of any APTA process edits

## Ongoing Maintenance

Our standards remain living documents after publication:

- Continuous acceptance of updates through GitHub
- Regular review of accumulated changes
- Periodic republication through APTA process
- Version tracking via Git tags
- Clear change history maintenance

This process ensures our standards:

- Stay current with industry developments
- Reflect real-world implementation experiences
- Maintain practical utility for agencies
- Support continuous improvement
- Preserve institutional knowledge
