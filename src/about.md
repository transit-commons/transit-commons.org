# About Our Collaboration

The transit-data.org initiative represents a unique collaboration between two key groups in the transit data ecosystem:

## TRB AP090(1) Transit Data Subcommittee

The Transportation Research Board's AP090(1) Transit Data Subcommittee on Data Infrastructure and Technology serves as a focal point for research and analysis in the transit data space. Our work includes:

- Conducting comprehensive research on transit data needs
- Analyzing emerging use cases and applications
- Evaluating current industry practices and trends
- Identifying gaps and opportunities in data infrastructure
- Publishing research findings and recommendations

## APTA Data Standards & Utilization Sub-working Group

The American Public Transportation Association's Data Standards & Utilization sub-working group focuses on practical implementation and standardization. Key activities include:

- Developing data guidelines and best practices
- Creating standardization frameworks
- Supporting transit agencies in data implementation
- Facilitating knowledge sharing across the industry
- Publishing official standards documents

## Our Combined Mission

Together, these groups create a powerful synergy between research and implementation:

1. **Research Informs Practice**: TRB's research findings directly influence APTA's standards development
2. **Practice Guides Research**: Real-world implementation challenges help shape research priorities
3. **Unified Approach**: Coordinated efforts ensure alignment between academic research and industry needs
4. **Industry Impact**: Combined expertise leads to more effective and practical solutions

This collaboration ensures that transit data standards and practices are both theoretically sound and practically implementable.
