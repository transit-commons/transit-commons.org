The transit industry relies on several key data standards that enable interoperability and efficient data exchange between systems.

- [GTFS Schedule](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/): Core transit schedule and fare specification
    - [GTFS-Fares v2](https://gtfs.org/community/extensions/fares-v2/): Advanced fare product and pricing model
    - [GTFS-Flex](https://gtfs.org/community/extensions/flex/): Demand-responsive and flexible transit services
    - [GTFS-Pathways](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/examples/pathways/): Indoor/outdoor navigation paths and accessibility
- [GTFS Realtime](https://gtfs.org/documentation/realtime/reference/): Real-time transit vehicle positions, trip updates, and alerts
